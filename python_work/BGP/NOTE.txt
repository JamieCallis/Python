server sends information via the connection, whereas
client sends information via the socket s.

server waiting for data

while True:
data = connection.recv(1024) #1024 bytes

print the data to the console, 

connection.send("reply")

client waiting for data
# seralises and prepares the data
message = raw_input("")

while True
# recieving
s.recv(2014)
# sending
s.send(message)

server is listening for a connection,
transitions from Idle to Connect state

Client then connects to the server,
and transitions to the connect state

both are in connect state - server upon reciving the
connect, should reply with Open to client and 
transiton to OpenSent.

When the server and client transition to connect state
the trigger in connect state is called.

This then calls open_sent 

we can to send a open message via the open_sent for the server.
Then recieve it via the client and transition both to open_sent
